#A wesbite for our student chaper

Our SPE student chapter is one of the best student chapters in the middle east, which is why I and the president of our chapter worked on this website. He has since graduated from university and the complete management, upkeep, and development of the website was handled by me on the original repository. [link to the original repo](https://spebuog.vercel.app/).

I worked on the implementation of a double language system (Arabic and English), which was a challenge due to the fact that the entire website has to change when changing from an LTR language to an RTL one. It was a challenge that I completed with resounding results nontheless.

It's also 100% responsive on PCs, mobile phones, tablets and even laptops. All of which have different layouts.

The website is connected to headless CMS (sanity), which pulls informations about lectues, lecturers and different topics using React Hooks.

It was and contiues to be a pleasure to work on this project.
